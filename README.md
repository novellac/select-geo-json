# select-geo-json
Select option values for geographic areas, in JSON format.

## Description
I needed a set of geographic areas for use in the [link] (https://vuejs.org/ "Vue") app I was making. I didn't find what I needed, so I created it. It can be used in any HTML form (or anywhere you use JSON). 

## Data Source
- Countries - The countries list was adapted from [link] (https://www.drupal.org/ "Drupal 8") Webform preset list of countries.
- US States - The states list was adapted from Drupal 8 Webform preset list of US states.
- Canada Provinces - The provinces list was adapted from the [link](https://gist.github.com/pbojinov/a87adf559d2f7e81d86ae67e7bd883c7 "Github gist") by [link] (https://gist.github.com/pbojinov "pbojinov").
