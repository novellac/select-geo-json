# select-place-json
Select option values for geographic areas, in [JSON](https://www.json.org/) format.

## Background
I needed a set of geographic areas for use in the [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) app I was making. I didn't find what I needed, so I created it. It can be used in any HTML form (or anywhere you use JSON). 

## Data Sources
- Countries - The countries list was adapted from [Drupal 8](https://www.drupal.org/) Webform preset list of countries.
- US States - The states list was adapted from Drupal 8 Webform preset list of US states.
- Canada Provinces - The provinces list was adapted from the [Github gist](https://gist.github.com/pbojinov/a87adf559d2f7e81d86ae67e7bd883c7) by [pbojinov](https://gist.github.com/pbojinov).
